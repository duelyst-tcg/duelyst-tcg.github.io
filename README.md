## Credits

I wouldn't be here without any of these:

- Duelyst, for being a truly remarkable game
- [duelyst wiki](https://duelyst.fandom.com/), as I grabbed most information
  from there.
- [duelspot](https://duelspot.com), as I used most of the styling and data from
  there.
- [duelers/resources](https://github.com/Duelers/resources) for some missing
  images and other resources.
- [-norrinator-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Norrinator-/), for his version of
  physical duelyst, which inspired me to make this.
